# Reusable Analysis Patterns

## Clustering

Where many data points are present in a piece of analysis, it can be useful to break the data down into different groups. If no external classification scheme can be applied, it falls to the analyst to find a meaningful way of classifying the content of the data.

After identifying groups, their individual properties can be compared and contrasted with one another, usually providing a means to construct an illustrative narrative, or to tease out group-specific relationships with other data that might have been otherwise lost across a noisy channel.

### K-Means Clustering

### Agglomorative Clustering

### NNMF Clustering

### Choosing a number of clusters - finding "the elbow"
