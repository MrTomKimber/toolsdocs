# Sphinx

Sphinx is a documentation tool used for preparing technical (often software related) documentation. It has capabilities for reading embedded "docstrings" in code, and automatically turning them into searchable technical documentation.

For Python development, adopting a healthy docstring habit is excellent practice and can save many hours of time later on. Additionally, it makes for clean, well documented code that can be worked on by teams of people.

Beyond python development usage, being able to generate documents from data makes Sphinx a strong contender for many other use-cases as well, including documentation of enterprise, data and system architectures.

## Installation

Install sphinx and associated myst parser

```
pip install sphinx myst-parser
```

After installing sphinx, run `sphinx-quickstart` to initialise the environment.

## Configuration

In the source folder, locate and open the `conf.py` file and update the extensions to include:

```
extensions = [ 'myst_parser', 'sphinx.ext.autosectionlabel' ]
```
* myst_parser - allows sphinx to compile [markdown](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/syntax.html)
* [sphinx.ext.autosectionlabel](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autosectionlabel.html) - eases labelling by setting title names to function as labels - n.b. you should ensure all labels are unique.

### Myst autogenerated header anchors

Per [this suggestion](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/optional.html?highlight=anchor#auto-generated-header-anchors), add the following to your `conf.py` file to better handle header-anchors to label definitions:

```
myst_heading_anchors = 3
```
